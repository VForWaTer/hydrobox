   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to HydroBox's documentation!
====================================

.. note::
   Major parts of the toolbox are currently re-written. Most interfaces of
   any function of version < 0.2 will most likely not work anymore.
   The aim is to produce a unified interface for hydrobox.
   Secondly, hydrobox is mainly pushed to reuse other Python packages within
   this scope, instead of re-implementing functions that are already there.

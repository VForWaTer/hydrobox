## Description

**The HydroBox is mainly a toolbox used in the [V-FOR-WaTer](https://vforwater.de) Project. It will be expanded to serve general hydrological data exploration with a future release.**

The HydroBox package is a toolbox for hydrological data analysis developed at the [Chair of Hydrology](https://hyd.iwg.kit.edu/english/index.php) at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/english/index.php).

The full documentation can be found at: https://vforwater.github.io/hydrobox

HydroBox has several submodules called toolboxes, which are a collection of functions and classes for specific purposes. As of this writing, the toolboxes are:

* `geostat` for geostatistics. Mainly implemented through `scikit-gstat` and `gstools`

In development are:

* `uncertainty_framwork` for uncertainty analysis
* `bridget` for evapotranspiration tools

# HydroBox

#
**The HydroBox is mainly a toolbox used in the [V-FOR-WaTer](https://vforwater.de) Project. It will be expanded to
serve general hydrological data exploration with a future release.**

The HydroBox package is a toolbox for hydrological data analysis developed at the
[Chair of Hydrology](https://hyd.iwg.kit.edu/english/index.php) at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/english/index.php).
The HydroBox has a submodule called toolbox, which is a collection of functions and classes that accept common
numpy and pandas input formats and wrap around scipy functionality.

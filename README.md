# HydroBox

#
**The HydroBox is mainly a toolbox used in the [V-FOR-WaTer](https://vforwater.de) Project. It will be expanded to
serve general hydrological data exploration with a future release.**

The HydroBox package is a toolbox for hydrological data analysis developed at the
[Chair of Hydrology](https://hyd.iwg.kit.edu/english/index.php) at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/english/index.php).
HydroBox has several submodules called toolboxes, which are a collection of functions and classes for specific purposes.
As of this writing these toolboxes are:

* `geostat` for geostatistics. Mainly implemented through `scikit-gstat` and `gstools`

In development are:

* `uncertainty_framwork` for uncertainty analysis
* `britget` for evapotranspiration tools

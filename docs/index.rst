About
=====


The HydroBox package is a toolbox for hydrological data analysis developed at the
`Chair of Hydrology`_ at the `Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)`_.
The HydroBox has a submodule called toolbox, which is a collection of functions and classes that accept common
numpy and pandas input formats and wrap around scipy functionality. This way can:

- speed up common hydrological data analysis tasks
- integrate fully with custom numpy/pandas/scipy code

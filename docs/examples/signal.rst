Simplifying a Signal
====================

Whenever you seek to apply a tool on your data that will operate on each
value and this tool is time and / or resource consuming, it might be a good
idea to operate on as few values as possible. Simply removing duplicated
values is not always the best approach. Think of a discharge time series
where you want to calculate an index that depends on a previous state.

Set up a test case
------------------

The example below will show the idea behind the
:ref:`simplify<reference_simplify>` method of the ``signal`` submodule. At
first some imports.

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib as mpl
    mpl.style.use('ggplot')

And now setup and plot the test signal.

.. ipython:: python

    x = np.array([1., 1.2, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1., 0.5,
                  0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3,
                  0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.7, 1., 1.5, 1.6,
                  1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6])
    @savefig examples_sample_data.png width=6in
    plt.plot(x, '.--r');

Handling replicas
-----------------

There are a number of replications. We want to get rid of those.

.. ipython:: python

    from hydrobox.toolbox import simplify
    @savefig examples_simplified_sample.png width=6in
    plt.plot(simplify(x, flatten=False), '.--r');

Look at the amount of markers in both plots, where the signal gave a constant
 value. The replicas got dropped from the signal.

Handling sensor precision noise
-------------------------------

So far, this only removed subsequent value duplicates. The other signal
information this method can simplify is the constant repetition of two values.
This usually happens in environmental sensors either in constant conditions
or during really slow state changes. In these cases the signal can alternate
between two states within the sensor resolution. These recordings can be evened
out by setting the ``flatten`` attribute to True.

.. ipython:: python

    @savefig examples_simplified_sample2.png width=6in
    plt.plot(simplify(x, flatten=True), '.--r');

Of course, the index information was completely lost. In this example the
x-axis is just counting the occurrences of values. In case you need the index
information for further analysis, you have to extract the index and preserve
it, before calling the simplify method.

.. important::

    The preservation of indices, whenever the data is of type ``pandas.Series``
    is planned for a future release.


.. warning::

    Keep in mind that two very strong assumptions are underlying this method.
    It does change the signal dramatically. Ensuring that the sensor noise
    assumption is correct is completely up to you.
